## Key Features Explained

### Goal Model
The `Goal` struct includes:
- Unique identifier
- Name and description
- Duration in days
- Start and calculated end dates
- Priority level with color coding
- Completion status
- Progress calculation
- Overdue detection

### Data Management
The `GoalStore` class provides:
- Observable object for SwiftUI integration
- CRUD operations for goals
- Automatic persistence using UserDefaults
- Filtered views for different goal states

### Timeline Visualization
The roadmap view features:
- Dynamic timeline positioning
- Goal bars sized proportionally to duration
- Color coding based on priority and status
- Today indicator line
- Smooth navigation between time periods

## Customization

### Colors
- Priority colors can be modified in `Goal.Priority.color`
- Timeline colors are customizable in `GoalTimelineCard`
- Accent color can be changed in the app's asset catalog

### Timeframes
- Additional timeframes can be added to `RoadmapView.Timeframe`
- Default timeframe can be changed in `selectedTimeframe`

### Goal Properties
- Additional goal properties can be added to the `Goal` struct
- Remember to update the Codable implementation for persistence

## Best Practices Used

- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of data and UI
- **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Proper use of @StateObject, @EnvironmentObject
- **Data Persistence**: Efficient local storage with UserDefaults
